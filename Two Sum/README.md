## üéØ What It Does

This visualizer helps you understand how to find two numbers that add up to a target using two different approaches:

- **Brute Force Method** - The "Check Everything" approach (simple to understand)
- **Hash Map Method** - The "Smart Lookup" approach (fast, single pass)

## ‚ú® Features

### üéÆ Interactive Controls
- **Array Input**: Type or paste comma-separated numbers
- **Target Input**: Set the target sum with visual feedback
- **Preset Examples**: Quick access to common test cases
- **Random Generator**: Generate random arrays for practice

### üîß Two Algorithms
- **Brute Force**: Shows nested loop traversal and pair checking

### üé¨ Playback Controls
- **Play/Pause**: Animated step-by-step execution
- **Step Forward/Back**: Manual navigation through steps
- **Speed Control**: 5 levels from very slow to very fast
- **Reset**: Start over with current settings

### üíª Multi-Language Support
- **Python**: Clean, readable syntax
- **JavaScript**: Modern ES6+ features
- **Java**: Object-oriented approach with helper methods

### üìö Educational Features
- **Real-time Explanations**: Plain English step-by-step commentary

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Direct Use
1. Download `index.html`
2. Open it in any modern web browser
3. Start exploring immediately!

### Option 2: Live Demo
Visit the live demo at: **[https://two-sum-leetcode.netlify.app/](https://two-sum-leetcode.netlify.app/)**

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. **Choose an Array**: Enter numbers like `2,7,11,15` or use presets
2. **Set Target**: Use the input field to set the target sum
3. **Pick Algorithm**: Select from Brute Force or Hash Map
4. **Watch the Magic**: Hit Play to see the algorithm in action!

### Example Walkthroughs

#### Example 1: `[2,7,11,15]` with `target=9`
- **Result**: `[0,1]` (indices of 2 and 7)
- **What happens**: 2 + 7 = 9, so we return their positions

#### Example 2: `[3,2,4]` with `target=6`
- **Result**: `[1,2]` (indices of 2 and 4)
- **What happens**: 2 + 4 = 6, so we return their positions

#### Example 3: `[3,3]` with `target=6`
- **Result**: `[0,1]` (indices of both 3s)
- **What happens**: 3 + 3 = 6, so we return their positions

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Space**: Play/Pause
- **‚Üê ‚Üí**: Step forward/backward
- **R**: Reset visualization

## üîç Algorithm Details

### 1. Brute Force Method
```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Check every pair of numbers
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]  # Found the pair!
    
    return []  # No solution found
```

**Pros**: Simple to understand, no extra space
**Cons**: Slow for large arrays
**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

### 2. Hash Map Method
```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}           # Store numbers we've seen
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num  # What number do we need?
        
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]  # Found the pair!
        
        hashmap[num] = i    # Remember this number and its position
    
    return []  # No solution found
```

**Pros**: Fast, single pass through array
**Cons**: Uses extra space for hash map
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)
