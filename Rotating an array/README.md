## üéØ What It Does

This visualizer helps you understand how to rotate an array to the right by k steps using three different approaches:

- **Extra Array Method** - The "Copy and Paste" approach (easy to understand)
- **Reverse Method** - The "Flip and Flip Again" trick (in-place, O(1) space)
- **Cyclic Replacements** - The "Musical Chairs" approach (mathematically elegant)

## ‚ú® Features

### üéÆ Interactive Controls
- **Array Input**: Type or paste comma-separated numbers
- **K Slider**: Adjust rotation steps with visual feedback
- **Preset Examples**: Quick access to common test cases
- **Random Generator**: Generate random arrays for practice

### üîß Three Algorithms
- **Extra Array**: Shows mapping arrows and temporary array
- **Reverse Method**: Visualizes the three-step reversal process
- **Cyclic Replacements**: Shows cycle detection and element movement

### üé¨ Playback Controls
- **Play/Pause**: Animated step-by-step execution
- **Step Forward/Back**: Manual navigation through steps
- **Speed Control**: 5 levels from very slow to very fast
- **Reset**: Start over with current settings

### üíª Multi-Language Support

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Direct Use
1. Download `index.html`
2. Open it in any modern web browser
3. Start exploring immediately!

### Option 2: Live Demo

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. **Choose an Array**: Enter numbers like `1,2,3,4,5,6,7` or use presets
2. **Set K**: Use the slider or input field to set rotation steps
3. **Pick Algorithm**: Select from Extra Array, Reverse, or Cyclic
4. **Watch the Magic**: Hit Play to see the algorithm in action!

### Example Walkthroughs

#### Example 1: `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` with `k=3`
- **Result**: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`
- **What happens**: Each element moves 3 positions to the right, wrapping around

#### Example 2: `[-1,-100,3,99]` with `k=2`
- **Result**: `[3,99,-1,-100]`
- **What happens**: Elements shift right by 2 positions

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Space**: Play/Pause
- **‚Üê ‚Üí**: Step forward/backward
- **R**: Reset visualization

## üîç Algorithm Details

### 1. Extra Array Method
```python
def rotate(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    temp = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        temp[(i + k) % n] = nums[i]
    
    nums[:] = temp
```

**Pros**: Easy to understand, straightforward
**Cons**: Uses O(n) extra space
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 2. Reverse Method
```python
def rotate(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    
    nums.reverse()           # Step 1: Reverse entire array
    nums[:k] = nums[:k][::-1]  # Step 2: Reverse first k elements
    nums[k:] = nums[k:][::-1]  # Step 3: Reverse remaining elements
```

**Pros**: In-place, constant extra space
**Cons**: Less intuitive, requires understanding of reversals
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

### 3. Cyclic Replacements
```python
def rotate(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    count = 0
    start = 0
    
    while count < n:
        current = start
        prev = nums[start]
        
        while True:
            next_idx = (current + k) % n
            nums[next_idx], prev = prev, nums[next_idx]
            current = next_idx
            count += 1
            
            if current == start:
                break
        
        start += 1
```

**Pros**: In-place, mathematically elegant
**Cons**: Complex to understand, requires cycle detection
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)
